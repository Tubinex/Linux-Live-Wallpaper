# Linux Live Wallpaper
This project is a solution for a personal problem of mine, 
problem being that I could not bring my animated wallpapers from Windows to Linux.
This project is supposed to serve as a partially solution to this problem by adding video wallpapers to linux.
So far there is no equivalent to the Scene, Web or Application wallpapers you could use on Windows 
but I might work on adding some of this missing functionallty in the future]

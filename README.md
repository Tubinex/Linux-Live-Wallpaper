# Linux Live Wallpaper
This project is a solution for a personal problem of mine, <br>
problem being that I could not bring my animated wallpapers from Windows to Linux.<br>
This project is supposed to serve as a partially solution to this problem by adding video wallpapers to linux.<br>
So far there is no equivalent to the scene, web or application wallpapers that you could use on Windows<br>
but I might work on adding some of these missing features in the future.<br>
